# WORLD CUP 2026 AFFILIATE PLAYBOOK

## Obsidian Weissach v7.4 — Strategic Implementation

### 1. THE MOAT: Universal Canonical Registry (WC2026 Edition)

The World Cup 2026 (48-team format) presents a fragmented identity problem. The `canonical_registry` must act as the "Source of Truth" bridging traditional sports data (ESPN) with emerging prediction markets.

- **Requirement**: Automated mapping of `espn_id` to `polymarket_id` and `kalshi_id` 96 hours before kickoff.
- **Goal**: Zero-latency navigation between "Analysis" and "Execution" (Affiliate).

### 2. THE ORACLE: High-Frequency Market Dislocation

World Cup markets are notoriously inefficient in the "Closing Window" (60m before kickoff) due to global liquidity surges.

- **Signal**: detecting "Pace Dislocation" in heavy-travel scenarios (e.g., Match in CDMX vs Seattle).
- **Metric**: `market_dislocation_pts` calibration for Soccer Totals (0.25 goal delta = 🚨 SHARP_STEAM).
- **Trace**: Providing a `kernel_trace` that explains *why* the market has it wrong based on "Physicality Models" and "Referee Intel".

### 3. THE YIELD: Global Affiliate Matrix

The revenue model shifts from 100% US-based books to a Global Prediction Layer.

| Tier | Platform | Use Case | Channel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SHARP** | Pinnacle | Fair Value Reference | Evidence |
| **CROWD** | Polymarket | Global/Political Sentiment | Yield |
| **RETAIL** | DraftKings | Match-Day Hyper-Local | Yield |
| **PRED** | Kalshi | Macro/Tournament Outcomes | Yield |

### 4. THE PROOF: Cryptographic Audit Trail

With an event every 4 years, "Historical Accuracy" is the primary currency.

- **Implementation**: Every World Cup analysis must be "Sealed" via `public.seal_technical_audit`.
- **Social Proof**: The permanent URL (`thedrip.ai/v/{hash}`) becomes the link-in-bio for all social distributions.
- **Grade**: "AAA" Grade requires a `sync_latency_ms` < 50ms and a `data_veracity` > 98.0.

### 5. THE GAPS: Anticipated Friction Points

- **48-Team Volatility**: Lower-tier teams (T64-T96) will have massive data gaps. Fallback: "Role-based modeling" (per Rule 1 of Gemini 3 protocol).
- **Latency Arbitrage**: International signal decay. Solution: "Edge Sentinel" deployment in satellite nodes (Vercel Edge Glue).
- **Regulatory Divergence**: Managing affiliate visibility based on user geolocation (RLS-driven).
